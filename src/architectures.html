    <h4> CPUs: Clock speed </h4>

    <ul>
      <li> Power consumed by a device $\propto fV^2$</li>
      <li> Historically, devices got faster by increasing clock frequency $f$
      <ul class = "inner">
         <li> Voltage $V$ decreased to keep power managable
      </ul>
      <li> Now, voltage cannot be decreased easily
      <ul class = "inner">
        <li> Bits are represented as a voltage difference
        <li> Engineering constraints mean a finite voltage difference must be
             maintained for correct operation
      </ul>
      <li> Increased clock frequency no longer available
    </ul>

      <li> Cache hierarchies
      <ul class = "inner">
        <li> Large on-chip caches to stage data
        <li> L1, L2, L3, ..., controllers, coherency mechanisms, ...

      </ul>
      <li> In practice, memory bandwidth can be important

  <section>

     <h4> CPUs: Parallelism </h4>

    <ul>
      <li> Source of increased performance now to use more cores
